# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the app to **"K's Lab repair and customization"** across branding constants, UI text, and page metadata.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/lib/branding.ts` so `APP_NAME` is exactly "K's Lab repair and customization" and any derived titles reflect the new name.
- Replace all user-facing occurrences of "K's Lab Customization" with "K's Lab repair and customization" in the landing page hero heading, header brand text, footer copyright line, and `frontend/index.html` `<title>`.

**User-visible outcome:** The app consistently displays the updated name "K's Lab repair and customization" across the site header, landing hero, footer, and browser tab title.
